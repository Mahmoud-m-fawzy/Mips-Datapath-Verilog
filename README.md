# 🖥️ MIPS Datapath Implementation (Verilog)

This project implements the **MIPS Datapath** using Verilog HDL.  
The design includes datapath components such as ALU, Instruction Memory, Data Memory, and Multiplexers.  
**Note:** The Control Unit is not included in this project.

---

## 📌 Features
- Implementation of core MIPS datapath modules.
- Testbenches for verifying functionality.
- Modular design for easy extension.

## 🛠️ Modules Implemented
- `ALU.v` → Arithmetic Logic Unit  
- `DataMemory.v` → Data memory storage  
- `InstructionMemory.v` → Program instruction memory  
- `MUX.v` → Multiplexer modules  
- Testbenches for each module
